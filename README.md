## Customer Service Feature Implementation by Sanjaya Raga

For this take-home assignment I chose the **Customer Service** role and built a complete customer support UI inside the existing React/Vite frontend.

### How to Access

The support pages keep the app's mobile-first layout:

1. Run the frontend (`npm run dev`) and open http://localhost:5173
2. Tap the **Support** (headphones) button in the Bottom Nav
3. From there you can open any of the new pages:
   - **Help Center** (`/support/help`) — searchable FAQ accordion + step-by-step tutorial tabs
   - **Contact Us** (`/support/contact`) — validated contact + feedback forms
   - **Ticket Dashboard** (`/support/dashboard`) — filterable support ticket table

A **Live Chat** floating widget is available on every page via the chat button in the bottom-right corner.

You can also visit the routes directly: `/support/help`, `/support/contact`, `/support/dashboard`.

### Bonus Features

- **Knowledge Base** — searchable, category-filterable help articles (available on the Help Center page).
- **User Satisfaction Survey** — emoji-based satisfaction rating with optional comment (on the Contact page).
- **Support Ticket Tracking** — filterable ticket table by status (on the Dashboard page).
- **Customer Service Analytics mockup** — stat cards, tickets-by-status/category, and weekly volume bars (top of the Dashboard page).
- **Multi-language support structure** — `LanguageProvider` + `useLanguage` hook with EN/ID dictionaries (`src/data/translations.ts`), toggled via the global `LanguageToggle` on the Help Center page.

### Tech Stack & Decisions

- **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** components (Card, Table, Accordion, Tabs, Input, Select, Badge, ScrollArea, Button, etc.)
- **Mock data only** — static, strongly-typed JSON lives in `src/data/` (`faqs.ts`, `tutorials.ts`, `tickets.ts`, `support.ts`). No backend or real API calls for the CS features, per the role constraints.
- **Functional components with hooks** (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) and a clean modular structure (`src/components/cs/`, `src/pages/support/`).
- **Responsive mobile-first UI** constrained to the app's `max-w-md` layout; wide content such as the ticket table scrolls horizontally on small screens without breaking the layout.
- **Simple client-side validation** with inline error messages and toast feedback on form submission.
- **Routing** wired in `src/App.tsx` under the `/support/*` namespace.
